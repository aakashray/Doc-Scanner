A **self-contained document scanning and matching system** with a built-in credit system, designed for efficiency and scalability. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and Node.js, this project features AI-powered document matching using OpenAI embeddings, a sleek animated frontend, and a robust admin dashboard—all without relying on third-party frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with hashed passwords (bcrypt).
- **Credit System**:
  - 20 free scans daily per user (auto-resets at midnight).
  - Users can request additional credits; admins approve exact amounts.
- **Document Scanning & Matching**:
  - Upload plain text files for scanning.
  - AI-driven similarity matching using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` model and cosine similarity (threshold: 0.8).
- **Smart Analytics Dashboard**:
  - Tracks scans, credits, and user activity for admins.
  - Displays pending credit requests with one-click approval.
- **Frontend Design**:
  - Modern UI with gradient backgrounds, card layouts, and subtle animations (fade-in, slide-up, pulse, bounce).
  - No frameworks—just pure HTML/CSS magic!
